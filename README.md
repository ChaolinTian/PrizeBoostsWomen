# Prize-Recognition-Boosts-Women's-Scientific-Status-and-Career-Longevity
## Codes and data for reproducing results
This repository contains the code and data used to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Prize Recognition Boosts Women’s Scientific Status and Career Longevity More than Men’s".

## Datasets
This repository includes the following datasets:
* 'figure_1_data.pkl': This dataset contains the yearly number of papers and citations of women and men prizewinners and contenders before and after prizewinning, used to reproduce the results of the first figure.
* 'figure_2_data.csv': This dataset contains the academic career length after prizewinning of women and men prizewinners and contenders, used to reproduce the results of the second figure.

## Code 
The code for this project is organized into two scripts, each serving a specific purpose:
* 'Figure_1.ipynb':This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code to analyze the figure_1_data.pkl dataset.
* 'survival_probability_curve.do': This Stata script contains commands to analyze the figure_2_data.csv dataset.

## Code structure
* 'Figure_1.ipynb': Reproduces results shown in the first figure using Python.
* 'survival_probability_curve.do':  Reproduces results shown in the second figure using Stata.
